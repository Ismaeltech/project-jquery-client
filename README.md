# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Technologies Used
-html
-css
-bootstrap
-sass
-javascript

## Planning
## The plan for this project was to keep the application as simple as possible. While using the techniques and methods my classmates and I learned in the first unit of the program. I focused on building the form authentications, then after the API aspect I moved onto the game logic. I wanted to implement a nice styling with the css as well.

## Unsolved Problems
## I would like to make the game mobile friendly.
##

## Future Features
## I would like to implement sound effects as the user interacts with the game board.
